# SA: delays Don't really want to advocate for getting rid of DST, and skipping xpert would have TB detection downsides that we aren't modeling. 
## ...so the main question of interest may be the elimination of delays associated with needing a separate DR regimen -- 
## ... i.e. what additional benefit from using the same drug combination for nearly all patients. For this, would want a regimen delay,
## ... and want to see how each of the scenarios is affected by it, so run the whole impact (and DST?) blocks again.
## ... Or maybe, just the impact blocks (although novelrr wouldn't change anything))
